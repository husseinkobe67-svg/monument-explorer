                    Dolmabahçe Palace is one of the most magnificent and luxurious monuments in Turkey,
                    representing the final era of the Ottoman Empire. Built between 1843 and 1856 under
                    the order of Sultan Abdülmecid I, the palace was designed to reflect European elegance
                    and modernity. Unlike earlier Ottoman palaces, Dolmabahçe combines Baroque, Rococo,
                    and Neoclassical architectural styles with traditional Ottoman design. Located along
                    the Bosphorus Strait, the palace served as the main administrative center of the empire
                    and symbolized a shift toward Western influence. It is also historically significant
                    as the residence where Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the founder of modern Turkey, spent his
                    final days. Today, Dolmabahçe Palace stands as a powerful symbol of transition, luxury,
                    and historical change.
