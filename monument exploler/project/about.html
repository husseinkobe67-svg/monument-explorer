        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>
          We are a team of five students — Hussein, Zeinab, Aya, Mhmd, and Carla — who worked hard and
          collaboratively on this project. Each team member contributed their time, effort, and ideas
          to design, develop, and present this website. Through teamwork and dedication, we combined
          our skills to create a meaningful and informative project.

        <h2>Project Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          The main purpose of this project is to educate and inform users about historical monuments
          while developing our web development skills. We chose to focus on monuments in Istanbul
          to highlight their historical, cultural, and architectural importance. This project aims to
          present reliable information in a clear, organized, and visually appealing way. It also
          allowed us to practice teamwork, creativity, research, and time management while applying
          what we learned in class to a real-world digital project.

        <h2>Tools & Technologies Used</h2>
        <p>
          This website was built using core web development technologies. <strong>HTML</strong> was used
          to structure the content and create the layout of each page. <strong>CSS</strong> was used to
          design the website, control colors, fonts, spacing, and ensure a clean and user-friendly
          appearance. <strong>JavaScript</strong> was used to add interactivity and enhance the user
          experience. By combining these tools, we were able to create a responsive, organized, and
          engaging website from scratch.
