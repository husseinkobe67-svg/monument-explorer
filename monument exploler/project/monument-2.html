                    According to the famous legend of Kız Kulesi, an emperor was told by a fortune teller that his daughter would
                    die from a snake bite on her eighteenth birthday. To protect her, the emperor built a tower in the middle of
                    the sea and sent his daughter to live there. However, on her birthday, a basket of fruit was brought to the
                    tower, and a snake hidden inside the basket bit the princess, causing her death. Because of this tragic
                    story, Kız Kulesi is known as the Maiden’s Tower and is seen as a symbol of fate and destiny in Turkish
                    legends.
